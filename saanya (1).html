            <p><b><i>Rhinos have been around for millions of years and play a crucial role in their ecosystem.They're important grazers,
                consuming large amounts of vegetation, which helps shape the African landscape. This benefits other animals and keeps
                 a healthy balance within the ecosystem.</i></b></p>

            <h3><b><u><i>THREATS</i></b></u></h3>
            <p><b><i>Human activity has caused this dramatic decline in rhino numbers. Initially,numbers dropped
                due to hunting, but today the main threats to rhino are poaching and habitat loss.
                 Poaching and illegal trade of rhino horn has increased sharply since 2007.</i></b></p>
